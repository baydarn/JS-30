# Adding Up Times with Reduce Project

The aim of this project is using JS array functions such as **map** and **reduce** to compute total time of the given videos.

**Syntax of Map Function**
var new_array = arr.map(function callback(element, index, array) {
    // Return value for new_array
}[, thisArg])


**Syntax of Reduce Function**
arr.reduce(callback[, initialValue])
**callback** function takes four arguments, but often only the first two are used:

->**accumulator** : the returned value of the previous iteration
->**currentValue** : the current item in the array
->**index** : the index of the current item
->**array** : the original array on which reduce was called
The initialValue argument is optional. If provided, it will be used as the initial accumulator value in the first call to the callback function.
